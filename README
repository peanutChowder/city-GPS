Running Instructions:
	1. Compile and make the 'server' executable by running 'make server' within the soln/server/ directory

	2. Run the 'run' target within the soln/ directory by running 'make run'

	3. A second terminal and a window will appear displaying the map of Edmonton. Click two points on the map to determine the lowest cost distance. Zoom in/out using 'q' and 'e' on the keyboard, and use wasd to move around the map.
	The terminal displays debugging information.

	4.  Close the window once finished.

Modified files:
	* server.cpp

Notes and Assumptions:
	- For the provided edge and vertex data (edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt by default):
		- Every vertex must have a unique ID
		- Vertices in an edge must be declared before the edge
		- There cannot be any commans in street names or coordinates
		- Each entry is expected to be separated with a newline

	- The soln/Makefile does not check whether the 'server' executable has been made

	- Program fails if user attempts to manually run the client side program before the server side program
